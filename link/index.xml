      <description>Evented vs Threaded
On this post I talk about the main differences between the Threaded and the Evented models and how they work by doing an analogy of a real situation that easy explains both models.
The Threaded model&amp;rsquo;s analogy is about a bank and how the people is assigned to a cashier, if the cashiers are busy then the people will start to queue, so this is how the resources are blocked, until a cashier is free to atend a person, that resource or thread is blocked.</description>
