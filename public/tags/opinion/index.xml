      <description>For about 3 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a women in tech community that has the objective to increase the number of women participating in technology, and trying to achive this main objective I got the idea to start a blog project that gathers some of the brightest women I know as writers of this blog and that for a year will write a post about technology every week.
I know most of those selected women for this project and the others that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting to see their talent.</description>

      <description>Now a days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that EVERYBODY must know how to program, due the technology is everywhere, due your abilities and skills will be developed in a creative way.
I think all of these arguments are valid and I really agreed them, but I believe that be a programmer is now more than just know how to program. If everybody learn how to program, I don&amp;rsquo;t think all become into programmers, the evolution of the software is turning the meaning into a more complex and complete definition.</description>
