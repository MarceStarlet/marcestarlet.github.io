      <description>Now a days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that EVERYBODY must know how to program, due the technology is everywhere, due your abilities and skills will be developed in a creative way.
I think all of these arguments are valid and I really agreed them, but I believe that be a programmer is now more than just know how to program. If everybody learn how to program, I don&amp;rsquo;t think all become into programmers, the evolution of the software is turning the meaning into a more complex and complete definition.</description>
