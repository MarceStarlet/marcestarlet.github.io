      <description>For about 3 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a women in tech community that has the objective to increase the number of women participating in technology, and trying to achive this main objective I got the idea to start a blog project that gathers some of the brightest women I know as writers of this blog and that for a year will write a post about technology every week.
I know most of those selected women for this project and the others that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting to see their talent.</description>
